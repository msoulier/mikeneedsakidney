Hi, I’m Mike and welcome.

A bit of information about myself.  I was born in Toronto to a small but loving
family. I spent time playing baseball as a kid, and lived on my bicycle.

By the time I was a teenager I was learning drums and guitar. Music has always
been a passion. In university, I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to do.  I
obtained a degree in Physics. I wasn’t sure I wanted to do a Masters but I
loved teaching, so I ended up going to Teacher’s college for my bachelor of
education. Having difficulty finding a full-time teaching position, I went back
to university to do a degree in Computer Science. There, I found my true
passion and also met my soon to be wife.

My path lead to Ottawa when I got at internship at Nortel Networks, which was
hot stuff back then. My how times have changed. I did well enough in my
internship that they offered me a full-time position. Around that time, I
married my wife. She also moved to Ottawa to work for Nortel.

We ended up buying our first house when we found out we were expecting.  We
moved to Stittsville in 2002, back when it was a few homes and miles of farmers
fields.  This time of my life was a bit of a blur.  I quit my job at Nortel and
moved to Mitel, where I am today, we had two kids and were busy raising a
family.

I didn’t find out I had kidney disease until 2008, when the doctor noticed
something during a routine physical. Since then, I’ve been working to delay the
disease's progression through a combination of diet and exercise.  It was working
until this past year when my numbers dropped low enough that doctors were
concerned about kidney failure and started to talk seriously about me needing a
transplant.

I'm trying to use this site to raise awareness about kidney disease, and 
organ donation in general. And possibly get some help for myself, if anyone
was so inclined.

Thanks for stopping by. See the [Donation](/donation/) page if you'd like to help.
