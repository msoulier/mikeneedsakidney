Hello! I appreciate your time. I know I'm just some guy living in Stittsville, Ontario, so thanks. 

So, the short version of this is that I have likely had kidney disease all of my life and they only found it in 2008. From there I was hoping that things would get better, or at least not get any worse. No such luck.

See the top-right of this page for more information.
