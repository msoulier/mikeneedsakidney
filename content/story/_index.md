# TL;DR

I know, my attention span isn't what it used to be either. Ok, so the short story is that apparently, I had an undiagnosed urinary tract infection as an infant, and both kidneys were damaged. Then when I grew to adulthood, my kidneys could no longer handle the load.

The problem was detected in 2008 and I've been monitored every since. I was hoping not to get to this point obviously, but here we are. Keep reading if you want to know more, but that's the most pertinent issue right now.


# Growing up

Oh, this is going to be long. Ok, so I was born asthmatic, quite seriously so. I got to know all of the fine people in the Emergency Ward before the age of 5.

Initially while my mother was desperately looking for help from doctors, they were prescribing Valium to her. Yeah&#x2026;that happened. Some damage was permanently done to my lungs during this period. Thankfully it was damage that I could compensate for with exercise.

My mother finally found a decent doctor by the name of Dr. Chu, who listened and ordered an X-Ray of my chest, which quickly confirmed my asthma. He then offered to testify if my mother wanted to sue the aforementioned doctors. For the record, she was not interested in revenge.

From there my health improved. I played baseball. I rode my bicycle **a lot**.


# Adulthood

No health issues from that point on for years. In my late 20s I noticed some muscle tension issues, and chronic fatigue. I didn't think too much of it, and at the time my doctor suggested that Prosac could help with my fatigue. I took a pass on that one.

The end of my 20s were a blur, as I got married, changed jobs and bought a house, moving to Stittsville. Oh, and we had our first child. Y'know, minor life changes like that. I started having issues taking a full, deep breath. And I started having some chronic muscle pain in my right shoulder. The investigation began.

I had joint issues in my ankles, but I was still regularly hiking, biking, etc., without any real problems. Our focus was mostly on our kids, as by then we had a pair of them (2004).


# Stittsville

Stittsville was very good to me and my family. I've been a happy resident for, oh, about 23 years now. Same house. It was tempting to up-size, but I've always been a fan of getting what you really need from life, and being happy with it. I had a great little family, a loving and beautiful wife, my career was doing well&#x2026;why mess with it?

When the kids were little it was easy to get involved in the community. We tried to get them both interested in sports, we did the Tour Nortel with the kids in a chariot trailer on the back of my bike (tough climb, that Corkstown Road, with a trailer in tow).

I got into curling around 2009 and got the kids into it for a bit, helping out on the ice with the little rocks at the Huntley Curling Club. Great bunch of folks there, although for my curling I ended up at the Granite in Westboro (at the time anyway).

At the Granite I ended up helping on the ice with training new curlers. That was a lot of fun. Then I helped out as President of the Weekend Mixed League for a year or two. By then my kids were in the Little Rock program there too, for a while.

My older son had a fierce love of soccer though, and it took over his time. I ended up one of those parents sitting at the side of a soccer field in all weather, cheering him on. I even coached his last year in winter soccer, not that I was much more than a glorified secretary for young men who knew the game far better than I did. Still, it was fun.

But by then, things were starting to get harder. 


# Kidney Disease

In 2008 on a routine physical my doctor found protein in my urine. I was referred to the Chronic Kidney Disease clinic at the Ottawa Hospital, Riverside Campus. I started seeing a doctor named Dr. Bell, a nice guy who did what he could to monitor the situation and attempt to slow my fall. I had an ultrasound, which failed to find my left kidney for some reason. This prevented Dr. Bell from biopsying my kidneys as they used ultrasound to guide the needle and he did not want to stick a needle into my good kidney. He ordered a renal scan, which showed that my kidneys were handling load at 30%/70% for left/right kidneys respectively. Dr. Bell's theory on my disease was called [VUR](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/vesicoureteral-reflux-vur-infants-children), essentially an undiagnosed urinary tract infection when I was an infant. I am not a doctor, nor a Nephroligist. My only complaint was not being able to confirm that as my disease. I was told that the evidence supported this, and I accepted it.

At this point, I saw the clinic every year, and then every six months, and then every four months, and so on, as my decline continued and my kidney function plummeted. The clinic predicted that I had about a year of function left. That was at least five years ago. But, my decline did continue, just more slowly as I overhauled my diet to try to slow my decline in the only ways that I knew. I hit the gym, and tried to overhaul my health. I had limited success, most of which was my fault. My priorities needed an adjustment, and I was running out of time. I was very good at sticking my head in the sand and pretending that nothing was wrong. But ignoring the problem did not make it go away.

Then things got worse.


# Neurological Disease

Around 2014 I noticed that I was having a loss of sensation in my feet. I could still feel them, but less so than before, and the muscles felt tight and prone to cramping. I brought it up with my doctor, and she ordered an MRI. When she got the results she sent me to a Neurologist, but he did very little, saying that they would do nothing unless I was "falling over in an emergency room." No cause was provided. 

The problem came and went, with no treatment. I simply hoped to stay active and that the problem would go away. See a pattern here?

By 2021 my family was pointing out to me that I was walking funny. I was limping in an odd way, with my left leg dragging more than lifting and walking normally. I hadn't noticed but I did notice the fatigue in that leg. I couldn't walk as far anymore. Running was out of the question. And I didn't know why. I couldn't keep up with my family on hikes, and I thought that it must be my fault. I wasn't working hard enough. I was out of shape. I was lazy. I couldn't think of anything else, until I brought it up with my doctor and she sent me to another Neurologist. This time, the Neurologist looked at my left leg, the involuntary movements, the difficulty walking, and she said, "I think that we should just MRI everything." She ordered an MRI of my brain and my entire spine.

That MRI turned up brain and spine legions, along with spinal stenosis in some places. No idea why, but they sent me to see a Dr. Freedman in the MS Clinic of the General Campus. At my first visit he informed me that in 2014 that first MRI turned up a brain lesion then, but no follow-up was done about it. I don't recall them telling me about that, and he seemed genuinely confused about why nothing was done. He then told me, "Don't worry, we're going to figure out what's wrong with you." Finally! Yes! Someone who will give me answers!

At least, I thought so at the time. He ordered a lot of blood tests, and then ordered a lumbar puncture. The first puncture failed, the doctor said that he needle was not long enough due to the way my spine was shaped. I took his word for it, and he booked a follow-up where they would perform the lumbar puncture with the help of an x-ray.

That day was fun. By the time it was done I had half the hospital staff in the room trying to figure out why they couldn't get any Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) out of me. Well, they got a little, but they needed more for their testing. They finally concluded that due to the narrowing of my spine, it just wasn't going to happen and they needed to be happy with what they got.

The lab worked wonders with that small amount, and soon Dr. Freedman was on the phone telling me the worst. I had primary, progressive MS. Yay. He recommended as much exercise as I could manage, and a transition to the [Mediterranean Diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan), as they had found that it helped. I tried to stay positive in the face of this news, but I'll be honest with you. It was a struggle.

I had a follow-up appointment with the MS Clinic soon after. At which point, he confused me by looking at my results again, and concluding that he was not comfortable calling what I have, Multiple Sclerosis. Apparently some of the test data did not fit. I asked what we were going to do then, to find out, and he said that they had already run every test they knew of. I absorbed that information and processed it, thoroughly confused by the whole thing. What happened to finding out what was wrong with me?

My next appointment was not even held with Dr. Freedman, so I couldn't ask him. I was given a simple cognitive test instead. I ended up calling one of his nurses and asking about all of this, and I was told that it was possible that I had something that they have never seen before. So, I asked, "Great. What is going to be done to find out?" I was told that they had already done what they could. Apparently, those episodes of House had all lied to me.

Meanwhile, my walking was not improving, and the feeling in my feet was making me wonder if I was going to lose my ability to drive. I had already lost my ability to walk for long periods, so my freedom was quickly eroding. Oh, did I mention that the Neurological damage caused issues with bladder and bowel control too? I'm at the point where leaving the house causes anxiety. Travel seems impossible, but I can't avoid it all the time. We went to Toronto twice last summer, and tool VIA Rail both times, as I'm no longer comfortable driving long distances. It worked, and so did Uber once we were in town, but they are quite expensive. I fasted on the train. It's simpler that way.


# The Kidneys Continue

So, back to the kidneys, and up to today. It's 2025, and my kidney function is at about %15. Due to this, the doctors in the CKD clinic are recommending that I prep for dialysis. I am planning Peritoneal Dialysis, as I can do that at home eventually, without hauling my ass into the hospital. I don't think it's going to be fun. I am trying to stay positive, and stick to a daily regimen of workouts, to do all that I can for my health, but the Neurological symptoms are making that difficult, and the chronic fatigue is a constant obstacle.

I don't know if I have failed to push enough to get answers. I don't know if I should go elsewhere, for a second opinion. I don't know if it's too late for any of that, and if I have somehow failed myself and my family by not acting sooner. I just&#x2026;don't know. And no one is answering.

So&#x2026;yeah.

If you got this far, thanks for your time. I'm not sure I would have, in your place.
