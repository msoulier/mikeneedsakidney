Why organ donation is not an opt-out option in this country, I am not sure. Other countries have made that change,
[Spain](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02128-7/fulltext) for example. Not to mention our own province of
[Nova Scotia](https://novascotia.ca/organ-tissue-donation/). I think it's because people tend to have an irrational connection to a dead body, even though the magic ingredients that made that person a unique, wonderful, alive person are now gone. I suppose I get it, even if I don't share those feelings. Personally, I told my kids to throw me on the composter, but I doubt that's legal. It should be. Let my body break down and have a tree grow on the spot or something. 

But that's not what this is about really. I'm talking about a living donation, which is far, far more precious and benevolent. Imagine saving someone else's life.

I'll admit, for a complete stranger, I likely wouldn't do it. But maybe after I got to know them for a while. Maybe. I can't be sure, to be honest. 

If you are genuinely interested in learning more, some great people are available to talk to at the
[kidney donor program](https://www.tohlivingkidneydonation.com/) of the Ottawa Hospital.
