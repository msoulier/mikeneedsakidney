Usually when it comes to government you can pretty much guarantee that if there
is a "right way" to do something, it is probably *not* being done by your
government, either through incompetence or corruption. Sad but true. And when
they want to change, it is usually a slow, painful process that is far more
costly than it should be.

But now and then, a government gets something right. For example, in Singapore,
organ donation is opt-out, not opt-in, like it should be. Here,

I've said it before, I'll say it again. If you're dead, you don't need your
organs anymore. This is just a no-brainer. Any religious ideas of "violating the
body" are just nonsense in my opinion. You cannot harm a dead person. The body
is meat, which will decay into the ground, assuming a burial. Given how our
bodies all end up, what is the problem with allowing your organs to save someone
else? 

C'mon Canada, this is obvious!
