More on change.org, people in need that are way ahead of what I had planned to start.

[This one](https://www.change.org/p/save-lives-with-opt-out-aka-implied-consent-organ-donation?source_location=search)
is about trying to improve the situation in all of Saskatchewan by implementing an opt-out system for organ donation, which would increase the availability of vital organs for patients across the province, saving a lot of lives. Not to mention improving the quality of those lives.

I want to see the same thing happen in Ontario. It's a no-brainer for me. I haven't a clue why in 2025 this has not been done.
