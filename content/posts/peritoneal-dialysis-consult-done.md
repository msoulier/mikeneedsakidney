So, this morning I went to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,
specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for
Dialysis.

Ye Gods, I don't want to do this. But I don't feel like dying yet, so I guess I have to. 

Surgery is now scheduled for early May. When I was asked if that was ok, I did respond honestly and said that, "none of this is ok and I'm barely holding it together", but that's not helpful so I followed up with, "sure". I'm a nice guy that way.

If you want to know more about Peritoneal Dialysis, check out
