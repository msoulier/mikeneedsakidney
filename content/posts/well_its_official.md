So, I just had a regular check-up with the CKD clinic. Sadly my kidney function
is now 9%. Yes, single digits. 

The nephrologist said that it's important to find the "sweet spot" to start
dialysis, between being strong enough to learn how, but close enough to really
need it. And she felt that this is that time, so I am now signed up for a 4-day
peritoneal dialysis course in about 2 weeks.

I am not pleased, but I have been expecting it, so it's not like it's a
surprise. I've booked the time off from work, as each day is like, 08:00 -
16:00, and thankfully my boss is very supportive. 

I am hoping that in time, dialysis will help me feel better than I do now. Plus,
the transplant list is based partially on how long you've been on dialysis, so I
need to begin to be considered for a transplant. Well, a non-living one, anyway.

I'm not sure how to feel about this. Honestly I'm a little numb at the moment.
The frustrated child in me keeps stomping his feet and yelling, "why can't they
just fix me?". The rational part of my brain knows that it's not that simple,
but it's not really speaking to my emotional side beyond calling it stupid and
childish.

Interesting. My rational side is kind of a dick. And the rest of me is a child.
That doesn't bode well for how I'm going to handle all of this. 

I'll keep you posted. If you're still there.
