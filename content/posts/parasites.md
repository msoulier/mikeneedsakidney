I'm surprised that it took this long. I've had the website up for a while now,
and I just appeared in Glen Gower's [newsletter](https://www.glengower.ca/).
He's our local city councillor, and was kind enough to give me a few minutes of
his time recently.

But not everyone is quite so altruistic. I just received an email from a "woman"
(who knows?) asking if I am looking for a kidney, when obviously I am. I pointed
her at the Ottawa Hospital [living donor
program](https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/clinical-services/deptpgrmcs/programs/kidney-donation/living-donation/),
and then did a quick search on her email address out of curiosity.

I found a post on the [Kidney Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kidney/) that
had been deleted but the search engine still had a cached copy of it. She was
offering the same to anyone on the subreddit, for a price. That is illegal in
the U.S., but apparently the laws in Canada are [somewhat
vague](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/canadian-laws-lax-on-sale-of-organs-says-transplant-expert-1.712379)
as of 2008. I'm not sure about today, but such laws tend to move slowly.

To be clear, if you want to use the living donor transplant program, giving an
organ cannot be transactional in any way. If you give, you are giving because
you want to help, and you expect nothing in return. If you are one of these
parasites, looking to prey on people when they are at their weakest, then for
your sake, I hope you never need the same, and you should be ashamed of
yourself. 

If you are not planning to leave the world better than you found it, then you
and I are likely not going to get along.
