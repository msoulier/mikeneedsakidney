I just came across [this story](https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/second-cruisin-for-organ-donors-gets-bigger-and-better-10746081) from the
Sudbury.com news.

I like the 'Vette. 

>   The car show featured premium cars as well as live music, an ice cream truck,
>   food vendors and a kid zone. Given the name, the event also featured a booth
>   where people could sign up to be organ donors.

And I love that. Nicely done people.
