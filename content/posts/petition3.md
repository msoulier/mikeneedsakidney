[This petition](https://www.change.org/p/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-canada-needs-to-adopt-an-opt-out-organ-donation-policy?source_location=search)
extends the idea of opt-out organ donation to the federal level. With that they could promote the concept to all provinces in this country, and save a lot of lives. 

I find it very difficult to explain a concept that I find completely obvious, so I don't know what more to say about this one.
