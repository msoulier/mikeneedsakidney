So, it would seem that my hoping, and occasional praying, for my condition to
turn around was, admittedly, a waste of time. Not really a surprise.

I was supposed to go to the course on Peritoneal Dialysis this month, but given
that my symptoms are not quite where the CKD clinic expects them to be, they
suggested that we wait until my assessment early next month to make a decision.
There is a very good chance that at the end of that I'll be signed up for the
course immediately.

It's a fun-filled 4 days at the hospital, with the first day starting off with a
blast with an outpatient procedure to open me up and pull out the catheters
inserted a few months ago. Then they teach me how to order supplies, and perform
the actual act of dialysis without giving myself a massive infection. 

Sound like fun? Yeah, me neither. I'll be sure to share the experience, as I am
under the illusion that someone is reading what I write. 

Cheers,
Mike
