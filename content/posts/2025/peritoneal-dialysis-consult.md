So, this morning I go to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,
specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for
Dialysis. I had hoped that this day would never come. Now that it's here, I am
feeling a wide range of conflicting emotions.

Did I do enough to prevent getting here?

Did I push alternate theories, did we really find the cause, and is there still
some larger problem looming?

Lets just say that I'm not looking forward to this. I'll try to hold it
together, but no guarantees.
