I was looking at change.org, thinking about creating a petition to make organ donation in Ontario opt-out instead of opt-in.
Seems that many people have beaten me to it. 

I will post what I found in a series of posts, starting with
[this one](https://www.change.org/p/gptaylormrd-opt-in-to-opt-out-policy-for-organ-donation?signed=true)
for little Nash. 

If you want to do some good, consider looking at some or all of these. They are all great ideas.
