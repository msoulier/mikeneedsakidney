So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I
always dread those. They're never good news. I mean, don't get me wrong, the
people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to
give me, and they're not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.

Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it's 10.
Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I'll find out in a month when I repeat the
testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y'know, that ain't good.

They also asked if I'm ok with being put into a reserved slot for training to
perform Peritoneal Dialysis, since apparently it takes weeks to offset the
symptoms of low kidney function using PD. The doctor told me that Hemodialysis
is much quicker and more effective, but I was advised to go with PD if I am
hoping for a transplant, since it is easier to "reverse" when you have the
transplant surgery. Plus, I can do it at home more easily, even if the power is
out. 

It also doesn't help that I recently had a raging case of Bronchitis, and spent
3 weeks coughing up my lungs, such as they are. The nurse told me that any
illness puts a strain on the kidneys. Lovely. 

So, I guess in a month we'll see if my numbers improve, or if I'm down to single
digits now. Meanwhile, I need to work on my fitness level. I'm tracking my
calories and really trying to drop some weight, but it seems to be an uphill
battle.

Must lift. Muscle good. Fat bad.
