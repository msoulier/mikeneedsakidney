      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking at change.org, thinking about creating a petition to make organ donation in Ontario opt-out instead of opt-in.&#xA;Seems that many people have beaten me to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will post what I found in a series of posts, starting with&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/gptaylormrd-opt-in-to-opt-out-policy-for-organ-donation?signed=true&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;for little Nash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do some good, consider looking at some or all of these. They are all great ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peritoneal Dialysis Consult Finished</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this morning I went to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,&#xA;specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for&#xA;Dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ye Gods, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this. But I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like dying yet, so I guess I have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surgery is now scheduled for early May. When I was asked if that was ok, I did respond honestly and said that, &amp;ldquo;none of this is ok and I&amp;rsquo;m barely holding it together&amp;rdquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s not helpful so I followed up with, &amp;ldquo;sure&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m a nice guy that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this morning I go to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,&#xA;specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for&#xA;Dialysis. I had hoped that this day would never come. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s here, I am&#xA;feeling a wide range of conflicting emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I do enough to prevent getting here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I push alternate theories, did we really find the cause, and is there still&#xA;some larger problem looming?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
