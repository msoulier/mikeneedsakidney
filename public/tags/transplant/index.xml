      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that it took this long. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the website up for a while now,&#xA;and I just appeared in Glen Gower&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.glengower.ca/&#34;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;He&amp;rsquo;s our local city councillor, and was kind enough to give me a few minutes of&#xA;his time recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is quite so altruistic. I just received an email from a &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(who knows?) asking if I am looking for a kidney, when obviously I am. I pointed&#xA;her at the Ottawa Hospital &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/clinical-services/deptpgrmcs/programs/kidney-donation/living-donation/&#34;&gt;living donor&#xA;program&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and then did a quick search on her email address out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I just had a regular check-up with the CKD clinic. Sadly my kidney function&#xA;is now 9%. Yes, single digits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nephrologist said that it&amp;rsquo;s important to find the &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo; to start&#xA;dialysis, between being strong enough to learn how, but close enough to really&#xA;need it. And she felt that this is that time, so I am now signed up for a 4-day&#xA;peritoneal dialysis course in about 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, it would seem that my hoping, and occasional praying, for my condition to&#xA;turn around was, admittedly, a waste of time. Not really a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to go to the course on Peritoneal Dialysis this month, but given&#xA;that my symptoms are not quite where the CKD clinic expects them to be, they&#xA;suggested that we wait until my assessment early next month to make a decision.&#xA;There is a very good chance that at the end of that I&amp;rsquo;ll be signed up for the&#xA;course immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I asked an old curling buddy (yes, those exist) about his experiences with&#xA;kidney disease. He&amp;rsquo;s farther along than I am, having just had a transplant&#xA;(yay!), so clearly I can learn from his experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He has gratiously permitted me to post this. I quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi Mike and Maria,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written in your blog posts or on Facebook. All&#xA;dates are rough, I am using My chart, but some of the data is really buried&#xA;and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a really good search engine on Mychart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
