      <p>So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I
always dread those. They&rsquo;re never good news. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the
people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to
give me, and they&rsquo;re not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.</p>
<p>Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it&rsquo;s 10.
Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I&rsquo;ll find out in a month when I repeat the
testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y&rsquo;know, that ain&rsquo;t good.</p>

<p>The car show featured premium cars as well as live music, an ice cream truck,
food vendors and a kid zone. Given the name, the event also featured a booth
where people could sign up to be organ donors.</p></blockquote>

      <p>I was looking at change.org, thinking about creating a petition to make organ donation in Ontario opt-out instead of opt-in.
Seems that many people have beaten me to it.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>So, last Wednesday I dropped by the Riverside Campus of the Ottawa Hospital at the crack of dawn to have
<a href="https://www.azuravascularcare.com/infodialysisaccess/what-you-should-know-about-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter-placement/">Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters</a>
surgically implanted in my body. Y&rsquo;know, I could have just stayed home and worked remotely, but I thought it would be
fun to get some good drugs and have some holes cut into me.</p>
<p>Seriously though, my kidney function is dropping (somewhere around an
<a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr">eGFR</a>
of 15 and on the way down) and my doctors think it&rsquo;s a good idea to prepare. I really can&rsquo;t argue, even though I have
been dreading being at this point from about 2008 onwards. Side note: I have learned from experience that sticking my
head in the sand and hoping that a medical condition will simply go away does <em>not</em> work. Who knew?</p>

<p>Ye Gods, I don&rsquo;t want to do this. But I don&rsquo;t feel like dying yet, so I guess I have to.</p>
<p>Surgery is now scheduled for early May. When I was asked if that was ok, I did respond honestly and said that, &ldquo;none of this is ok and I&rsquo;m barely holding it together&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s not helpful so I followed up with, &ldquo;sure&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m a nice guy that way.</p>
