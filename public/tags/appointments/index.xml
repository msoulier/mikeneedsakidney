      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I&#xA;always dread those. They&amp;rsquo;re never good news. I mean, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the&#xA;people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to&#xA;give me, and they&amp;rsquo;re not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 10.&#xA;Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I&amp;rsquo;ll find out in a month when I repeat the&#xA;testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y&amp;rsquo;know, that ain&amp;rsquo;t good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
