      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week, I spent four days of the work week at the hospital taking a course&#xA;on Peritoneal Dialysis. Yeah, fun. Want to spend days in a hospital that is a&#xA;major pain to reach due to horrible traffic and lack of urban planning, where&#xA;they surgically modify your body and then teach you how to live with those&#xA;modifications. Sound fun?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people were&amp;hellip;awesome. The nurses, orderlies, and the doctors could not have&#xA;been better in how I was treated. How &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were treated, actually, since my&#xA;amazing wife came with me. I mean, day one is scary enough, since they are&#xA;planning to cut you open and pull out the PD catheter so you can use it. They&amp;rsquo;re&#xA;going to use local anesthesia, but I&amp;rsquo;m always worried that it&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt&#xA;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that it took this long. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the website up for a while now,&#xA;and I just appeared in Glen Gower&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.glengower.ca/&#34;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;He&amp;rsquo;s our local city councillor, and was kind enough to give me a few minutes of&#xA;his time recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is quite so altruistic. I just received an email from a &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(who knows?) asking if I am looking for a kidney, when obviously I am. I pointed&#xA;her at the Ottawa Hospital &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/clinical-services/deptpgrmcs/programs/kidney-donation/living-donation/&#34;&gt;living donor&#xA;program&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and then did a quick search on her email address out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Well, it&#39;s official</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I just had a regular check-up with the CKD clinic. Sadly my kidney function&#xA;is now 9%. Yes, single digits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nephrologist said that it&amp;rsquo;s important to find the &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo; to start&#xA;dialysis, between being strong enough to learn how, but close enough to really&#xA;need it. And she felt that this is that time, so I am now signed up for a 4-day&#xA;peritoneal dialysis course in about 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter surgery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last Wednesday I dropped by the Riverside Campus of the Ottawa Hospital at the crack of dawn to have&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.azuravascularcare.com/infodialysisaccess/what-you-should-know-about-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter-placement/&#34;&gt;Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;surgically implanted in my body. Y&amp;rsquo;know, I could have just stayed home and worked remotely, but I thought it would be&#xA;fun to get some good drugs and have some holes cut into me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, my kidney function is dropping (somewhere around an&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr&#34;&gt;eGFR&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;of 15 and on the way down) and my doctors think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to prepare. I really can&amp;rsquo;t argue, even though I have&#xA;been dreading being at this point from about 2008 onwards. Side note: I have learned from experience that sticking my&#xA;head in the sand and hoping that a medical condition will simply go away does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peritoneal Dialysis Consult Finished</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this morning I went to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,&#xA;specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for&#xA;Dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ye Gods, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this. But I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like dying yet, so I guess I have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surgery is now scheduled for early May. When I was asked if that was ok, I did respond honestly and said that, &amp;ldquo;none of this is ok and I&amp;rsquo;m barely holding it together&amp;rdquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s not helpful so I followed up with, &amp;ldquo;sure&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m a nice guy that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this morning I go to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,&#xA;specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for&#xA;Dialysis. I had hoped that this day would never come. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s here, I am&#xA;feeling a wide range of conflicting emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I do enough to prevent getting here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I push alternate theories, did we really find the cause, and is there still&#xA;some larger problem looming?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
