      <description>&lt;p&gt;Usually when it comes to government you can pretty much guarantee that if there&#xA;is a &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; to do something, it is probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being done by your&#xA;government, either through incompetence or corruption. Sad but true. And when&#xA;they want to change, it is usually a slow, painful process that is far more&#xA;costly than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But now and then, a government gets something right. For example, in Singapore,&#xA;organ donation is opt-out, not opt-in, like it should be. Here,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moh.gov.sg/seeking-healthcare/organ-donation&#34;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/second-cruisin-for-organ-donors-gets-bigger-and-better-10746081&#34;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; from the&#xA;Sudbury.com news.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the &amp;lsquo;Vette.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The car show featured premium cars as well as live music, an ice cream truck,&#xA;food vendors and a kid zone. Given the name, the event also featured a booth&#xA;where people could sign up to be organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I love that. Nicely done people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chng.it/pB6N8rRQQw&#34;&gt;This petition&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;was started by my lovely wife in an effort to bring an updated petition to the&#xA;Premier of Ontario, in this case, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ola.org/en/members/all/doug-ford&#34;&gt;Doug Ford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are living in the province of Ontario, please consider signing this petition. The life you save could be your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re done with petitions now, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-canada-needs-to-adopt-an-opt-out-organ-donation-policy?source_location=search&#34;&gt;This petition&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;extends the idea of opt-out organ donation to the federal level. With that they could promote the concept to all provinces in this country, and save a lot of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find it very difficult to explain a concept that I find completely obvious, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what more to say about this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More on change.org, people in need that are way ahead of what I had planned to start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/save-lives-with-opt-out-aka-implied-consent-organ-donation?source_location=search&#34;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;is about trying to improve the situation in all of Saskatchewan by implementing an opt-out system for organ donation, which would increase the availability of vital organs for patients across the province, saving a lot of lives. Not to mention improving the quality of those lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to see the same thing happen in Ontario. It&amp;rsquo;s a no-brainer for me. I haven&amp;rsquo;t a clue why in 2025 this has not been done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking at change.org, thinking about creating a petition to make organ donation in Ontario opt-out instead of opt-in.&#xA;Seems that many people have beaten me to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will post what I found in a series of posts, starting with&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/gptaylormrd-opt-in-to-opt-out-policy-for-organ-donation?signed=true&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;for little Nash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do some good, consider looking at some or all of these. They are all great ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
