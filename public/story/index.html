    <section class="center w-60"><h1 id="tldr">TL;DR</h1>
<p>I know, my attention span isn't what it used to be either. Ok, so the
short story is that apparently, I had an undiagnosed urinary tract
infection as an infant, and both kidneys were damaged. Then when I grew
to adulthood, my kidneys could no longer handle the load.</p>
<p>The problem was detected in 2008 and I've been monitored every since. I
was hoping not to get to this point obviously, but here we are. Keep
reading if you want to know more, but that's the most pertinent issue
right now.</p>
<h1 id="growing-up">Growing up</h1>
<p>Oh, this is going to be long. Ok, so I was born asthmatic, quite
seriously so. I got to know all of the fine people in the Emergency Ward
before the age of 5.</p>
<p>Initially while my mother was desperately looking for help from supposed
doctors, they were prescribing Valium to her, since they were arrogant
morons who refused to listen to their patient. Some damage was
permanently done to my lungs during this period. Thankfully it was
damage that I could compensate for with exercise.</p>
<p>My mother finally found a decent doctor by the name of Dr. Chu, who
listened and ordered an X-Ray of my chest, which quickly confirmed my
asthma. He then offered to testify if my mother wanted to sue the
aforementioned doctors. For the record, she was not interested in
revenge.</p>
<p>From there my health improved. I played baseball. I rode my bicycle <strong>a
lot</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="adulthood">Adulthood</h1>
<p>No health issues from that point on for years. In my late 20s I noticed
some muscle tension issues, and chronic fatigue. I didn't think too
much of it, and at the time my doctor suggested that Prosac could help
with my fatigue. I was unimpressed and refused.</p>
<p>The end of my 20s were a blur, as I got married, changed jobs and bought
a house, moving to Stittsville. Oh, and we had our first child. Y'know,
minor life changes like that. I started having issues taking a full,
deep breath. And I started having some chronic muscle pain in my right
shoulder. The investigation began.</p>
<p>I had joint issues in my ankles, but I was still regularly hiking,
biking, etc., without any real problems. Our focus was mostly on our
kids, as by then we had a pair of them (2004).</p>
<h1 id="kidney-disease">Kidney Disease</h1>
<p>In 2008 on a routine physical my doctor found protein in my urine. I was
referred to the Chronic Kidney Disease clinic at the Ottawa Hospital,
Riverside Campus. I started seeing a doctor named Dr. Bell, a nice guy
who did what he could to monitor the situation and attempt to slow my
fall. I had an ultrasound, which failed to find my left kidney for some
reason. This prevented Dr. Bell from biopsying my kidneys as they used
ultrasound to guide the needle and he did not want to stick a needle
into my good kidney. He ordered a renal scan, which showed that my
kidneys were handling load at 30%/70% for left/right kidneys
respectively. Dr. Bell's theory on my disease was called
<a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/vesicoureteral-reflux-vur-infants-children">VUR</a>,
essentially an undiagnosed urinary tract infection when I was an infant.
I am not a doctor, nor a Nephroligist. My only complaint was not being
able to confirm that as my disease. I was told that the evidence
supported this, and I accepted it.</p>
<p>At this point, I saw the clinic every year, and then every six months,
and then every four months, and so on, as my decline continued and my
kidney function plummeted. The clinic predicted that I had about a year
of function left. That was at least five years ago. But, my decline did
continue, just more slowly as I overhauled my diet to try to slow my
decline in the only ways that I knew. I hit the gym, and tried to
overhaul my health. I had limited success, most of which was my fault.
My priorities needed an adjustment, and I was running out of time. I was
very good at sticking my head in the sand and pretending that nothing
was wrong. But ignoring the problem did not make it go away.</p>
<p>Then things got worse.</p>
<h1 id="neurological-disease">Neurological Disease</h1>
<p>Around 2014 I noticed that I was having a loss of sensation in my feet.
I could still feel them, but less so than before, and the muscles felt
tight and prone to cramping. I brought it up with my doctor, and she
ordered an MRI. When she got the results she sent me to a Neurologist,
but he did very little, saying that they would do nothing unless I was
&quot;falling over in an emergency room.&quot; No cause was provided.</p>
<p>The problem came and went, with no treatment. I simply hoped to stay
active and that the problem would go away. See a pattern here?</p>
<p>By 2021 my family was pointing out to me that I was walking funny. I was
limping in an odd way, with my left leg dragging more than lifting and
walking normally. I hadn't noticed but I did notice the fatigue in that
leg. I couldn't walk as far anymore. Running was out of the question.
And I didn't know why. I couldn't keep up with my family on hikes, and
I thought that it must be my fault. I wasn't working hard enough. I was
out of shape. I was lazy. I couldn't think of anything else, until I
brought it up with my doctor and she sent me to another Neurologist.
This time, the Neurologist looked at my left leg, the involuntary
movements, the difficulty walking, and she said, &quot;I think that we
should just MRI everything.&quot; She ordered an MRI of my brain and my
entire spine.</p>
<p>That MRI turned up brain and spine legions, along with spinal stenosis
in some places. No idea why, but they sent me to see a Dr. Freedman in
the MS Clinic of the General Campus. At my first visit he informed me
that in 2014 that first MRI turned up a brain lesion then, but no
follow-up was done about it. I don't recall them telling me about that,
and he seemed genuinely confused about why nothing was done. He then
told me, &quot;Don't worry, we're going to figure out what's wrong with
you.&quot; Finally! Yes! Someone who will give me answers!</p>
<p>At least, I thought so at the time. He ordered a lot of blood tests, and
then ordered a lumbar puncture. The first puncture failed, the doctor
said that he needle was not long enough due to the way my spine was
shaped. I took his word for it, and he booked a follow-up where they
would perform the lumbar puncture with the help of an x-ray.</p>
<p>That day was fun. By the time it was done I had half the hospital staff
in the room trying to figure out why they couldn't get any Cerebral
Spinal Fluid (CSF) out of me. Well, they got a little, but they needed
more for their testing. They finally concluded that due to the narrowing
of my spine, it just wasn't going to happen and they needed to be happy
with what they got.</p>
<p>The lab worked wonders with that small amount, and soon Dr. Freedman was
on the phone telling me the worst. I had primary, progressive MS. Yay.
He recommended as much exercise as I could manage, and a transition to
the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan">Mediterranean
Diet</a>,
as they had found that it helped. I tried to stay positive in the face
of this news, but I'll be honest with you. It was a struggle.</p>
<p>I had a follow-up appointment with the MS Clinic soon after. At which
point, he confused me by looking at my results again, and concluding
that he was not comfortable calling what I have, Multiple Sclerosis.
Apparently some of the test data did not fit. I asked what we were going
to do then, to find out, and he said that they had already run every
test they knew of. I absorbed that information and processed it,
thoroughly confused by the whole thing. What happened to finding out
what was wrong with me?</p>
<p>My next appointment was not even held with Dr. Freedman, so I couldn't
ask him. I was given a simple cognitive test instead. I ended up calling
one of his nurses and asking about all of this, and I was told that it
was possible that I had something that they have never seen before. So,
I asked, &quot;Great. What is going to be done to find out?&quot; I was told
that they had already done what they could. Apparently, those episodes
of House had all lied to me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my walking was not improving, and the feeling in my feet was
making me wonder if I was going to lose my ability to drive. I had
already lost my ability to walk for long periods, so my freedom was
quickly eroding. Oh, did I mention that the Neurological damage caused
issues with bladder and bowel control too? I'm at the point where
leaving the house causes anxiety. Travel seems impossible, but I can't
avoid it all the time. We went to Toronto twice last summer, and tool
VIA Rail both times, as I'm no longer comfortable driving long
distances. It worked, and so did Uber once we were in town, but they are
quite expensive. I fasted on the train. It's simpler that way.</p>
<h1 id="the-kidneys-continue">The Kidneys Continue</h1>
<p>So, back to the kidneys, and up to today. It's 2025, and my kidney
function is at about %15. Due to this, the doctors in the CKD clinic are
recommending that I prep for dialysis. I am planning Peritoneal
Dialysis, as I can do that at home eventually, without hauling my ass
into the hospital. I don't think it's going to be fun. I am trying to
stay positive, and stick to a daily regimen of workouts, to do all that
I can for my health, but the Neurological symptoms are making that
difficult, and the chronic fatigue is a constant obstacle.</p>
<p>I don't know if I have failed to push enough to get answers. I don't
know if I should go elsewhere, for a second opinion. I don't know if
it's too late for any of that, and if I have somehow failed myself and
my family by not acting sooner. I just&hellip;don't know. And no one is
answering.</p>
<p>So&hellip;yeah.</p>
<p>If you got this far, thanks for your time. I'm not sure I would have,
in your place.</p>
