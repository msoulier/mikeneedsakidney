    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Usually when it comes to government you can pretty much guarantee that if there
is a &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do something, it is probably <em>not</em> being done by your
government, either through incompetence or corruption. Sad but true. And when
they want to change, it is usually a slow, painful process that is far more
costly than it should be.</p>
<p>But now and then, a government gets something right. For example, in Singapore,
organ donation is opt-out, not opt-in, like it should be. Here,
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/seeking-healthcare/organ-donation">Check it out</a>.</p>

      <p>So, it would seem that my hoping, and occasional praying, for my condition to
turn around was, admittedly, a waste of time. Not really a surprise.</p>
<p>I was supposed to go to the course on Peritoneal Dialysis this month, but given
that my symptoms are not quite where the CKD clinic expects them to be, they
suggested that we wait until my assessment early next month to make a decision.
There is a very good chance that at the end of that I&rsquo;ll be signed up for the
course immediately.</p>

      <p>So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I
always dread those. They&rsquo;re never good news. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the
people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to
give me, and they&rsquo;re not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.</p>
<p>Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it&rsquo;s 10.
Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I&rsquo;ll find out in a month when I repeat the
testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y&rsquo;know, that ain&rsquo;t good.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>So, last Wednesday I dropped by the Riverside Campus of the Ottawa Hospital at the crack of dawn to have
<a href="https://www.azuravascularcare.com/infodialysisaccess/what-you-should-know-about-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter-placement/">Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters</a>
surgically implanted in my body. Y&rsquo;know, I could have just stayed home and worked remotely, but I thought it would be
fun to get some good drugs and have some holes cut into me.</p>
<p>Seriously though, my kidney function is dropping (somewhere around an
<a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr">eGFR</a>
of 15 and on the way down) and my doctors think it&rsquo;s a good idea to prepare. I really can&rsquo;t argue, even though I have
been dreading being at this point from about 2008 onwards. Side note: I have learned from experience that sticking my
head in the sand and hoping that a medical condition will simply go away does <em>not</em> work. Who knew?</p>
