      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet the last two months, getting used to the oh-so-fun&#xA;nightly task of peritoneal dialysis. As the year closes out, I figured that I&#xA;should provide an update.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, every day/night for most of the last two months, my routine has been:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;some time during the day, set up the cycler machine for that night&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;around 20:30, get ready for bed (can I party or what?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;clean my hands, sanitize my hands, and plug in by 21:00&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;wipe the connection threads down for excess iodine and hop into bed (otherwise&#xA;you end up with iodine stains on the sheets)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;go through four cycles over eight hours of&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;fill&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dwell&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;drain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;all while hopefully sleeping through the entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last week I was on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mikeneedsakidney.ca/posts/dialysis_training/&#34;&gt;dialysis training&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and now it&amp;rsquo;s the weekend. On friday, my dialysis supplies were delivered and my&#xA;cycler machine was set up in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nice guys who delivered my supplies carried them into my office for me, as&#xA;I specified. And damn, did they deliver a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/baxter_boxes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Boxes in my office&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The initial order was put in by the nurses, and they are teaching me how to&#xA;submit follow-up orders myself. I&amp;rsquo;m using a lot of google calendar. And there is&#xA;so much stuff that it&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming, but luckily my wife is good at organizing&#xA;stuff. While we were in the hospital being taught, she was making lists and&#xA;ordering shit on Amazon. We stopped by a dollar store for some organizational&#xA;compartments for drawers, and now my bed&amp;rsquo;s end-table is very well organized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week, I spent four days of the work week at the hospital taking a course&#xA;on Peritoneal Dialysis. Yeah, fun. Want to spend days in a hospital that is a&#xA;major pain to reach due to horrible traffic and lack of urban planning, where&#xA;they surgically modify your body and then teach you how to live with those&#xA;modifications. Sound fun?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people were&amp;hellip;awesome. The nurses, orderlies, and the doctors could not have&#xA;been better in how I was treated. How &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; were treated, actually, since my&#xA;amazing wife came with me. I mean, day one is scary enough, since they are&#xA;planning to cut you open and pull out the PD catheter so you can use it. They&amp;rsquo;re&#xA;going to use local anesthesia, but I&amp;rsquo;m always worried that it&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt&#xA;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that it took this long. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the website up for a while now,&#xA;and I just appeared in Glen Gower&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.glengower.ca/&#34;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;He&amp;rsquo;s our local city councillor, and was kind enough to give me a few minutes of&#xA;his time recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is quite so altruistic. I just received an email from a &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo;&#xA;(who knows?) asking if I am looking for a kidney, when obviously I am. I pointed&#xA;her at the Ottawa Hospital &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/clinical-services/deptpgrmcs/programs/kidney-donation/living-donation/&#34;&gt;living donor&#xA;program&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and then did a quick search on her email address out of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Well, it&#39;s official</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I just had a regular check-up with the CKD clinic. Sadly my kidney function&#xA;is now 9%. Yes, single digits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nephrologist said that it&amp;rsquo;s important to find the &amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;rdquo; to start&#xA;dialysis, between being strong enough to learn how, but close enough to really&#xA;need it. And she felt that this is that time, so I am now signed up for a 4-day&#xA;peritoneal dialysis course in about 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Singapore and their Organ Donation Policy</title>
      <link>http://mikeneedsakidney.ca/posts/singapore/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Usually when it comes to government you can pretty much guarantee that if there&#xA;is a &amp;ldquo;right way&amp;rdquo; to do something, it is probably &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being done by your&#xA;government, either through incompetence or corruption. Sad but true. And when&#xA;they want to change, it is usually a slow, painful process that is far more&#xA;costly than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But now and then, a government gets something right. For example, in Singapore,&#xA;organ donation is opt-out, not opt-in, like it should be. Here,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moh.gov.sg/seeking-healthcare/organ-donation&#34;&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, it would seem that my hoping, and occasional praying, for my condition to&#xA;turn around was, admittedly, a waste of time. Not really a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to go to the course on Peritoneal Dialysis this month, but given&#xA;that my symptoms are not quite where the CKD clinic expects them to be, they&#xA;suggested that we wait until my assessment early next month to make a decision.&#xA;There is a very good chance that at the end of that I&amp;rsquo;ll be signed up for the&#xA;course immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>July appointment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I&#xA;always dread those. They&amp;rsquo;re never good news. I mean, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the&#xA;people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to&#xA;give me, and they&amp;rsquo;re not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it&amp;rsquo;s 10.&#xA;Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I&amp;rsquo;ll find out in a month when I repeat the&#xA;testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y&amp;rsquo;know, that ain&amp;rsquo;t good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I asked an old curling buddy (yes, those exist) about his experiences with&#xA;kidney disease. He&amp;rsquo;s farther along than I am, having just had a transplant&#xA;(yay!), so clearly I can learn from his experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He has gratiously permitted me to post this. I quote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi Mike and Maria,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written in your blog posts or on Facebook. All&#xA;dates are rough, I am using My chart, but some of the data is really buried&#xA;and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a really good search engine on Mychart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/second-cruisin-for-organ-donors-gets-bigger-and-better-10746081&#34;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; from the&#xA;Sudbury.com news.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the &amp;lsquo;Vette.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The car show featured premium cars as well as live music, an ice cream truck,&#xA;food vendors and a kid zone. Given the name, the event also featured a booth&#xA;where people could sign up to be organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I love that. Nicely done people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter surgery</title>
      <link>http://mikeneedsakidney.ca/posts/peritoneal-dialysis-surgery/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, last Wednesday I dropped by the Riverside Campus of the Ottawa Hospital at the crack of dawn to have&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.azuravascularcare.com/infodialysisaccess/what-you-should-know-about-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter-placement/&#34;&gt;Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;surgically implanted in my body. Y&amp;rsquo;know, I could have just stayed home and worked remotely, but I thought it would be&#xA;fun to get some good drugs and have some holes cut into me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seriously though, my kidney function is dropping (somewhere around an&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr&#34;&gt;eGFR&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;of 15 and on the way down) and my doctors think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to prepare. I really can&amp;rsquo;t argue, even though I have&#xA;been dreading being at this point from about 2008 onwards. Side note: I have learned from experience that sticking my&#xA;head in the sand and hoping that a medical condition will simply go away does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; work. Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chng.it/pB6N8rRQQw&#34;&gt;This petition&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;was started by my lovely wife in an effort to bring an updated petition to the&#xA;Premier of Ontario, in this case, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ola.org/en/members/all/doug-ford&#34;&gt;Doug Ford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are living in the province of Ontario, please consider signing this petition. The life you save could be your own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re done with petitions now, right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With that they could promote the concept to all provinces in this country, and save a lot of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find it very difficult to explain a concept that I find completely obvious, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know what more to say about this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More on change.org, people in need that are way ahead of what I had planned to start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/save-lives-with-opt-out-aka-implied-consent-organ-donation?source_location=search&#34;&gt;This one&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;is about trying to improve the situation in all of Saskatchewan by implementing an opt-out system for organ donation, which would increase the availability of vital organs for patients across the province, saving a lot of lives. Not to mention improving the quality of those lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to see the same thing happen in Ontario. It&amp;rsquo;s a no-brainer for me. I haven&amp;rsquo;t a clue why in 2025 this has not been done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking at change.org, thinking about creating a petition to make organ donation in Ontario opt-out instead of opt-in.&#xA;Seems that many people have beaten me to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will post what I found in a series of posts, starting with&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/p/gptaylormrd-opt-in-to-opt-out-policy-for-organ-donation?signed=true&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;for little Nash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do some good, consider looking at some or all of these.

      <title>Peritoneal Dialysis Consult Finished</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this morning I went to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,&#xA;specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for&#xA;Dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ye Gods, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do this. But I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like dying yet, so I guess I have to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surgery is now scheduled for early May. When I was asked if that was ok, I did respond honestly and said that, &amp;ldquo;none of this is ok and I&amp;rsquo;m barely holding it together&amp;rdquo;, but that&amp;rsquo;s not helpful so I followed up with, &amp;ldquo;sure&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m a nice guy that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, this morning I go to consult with a surgeon about Peritoneal Dialysis,&#xA;specifically having PD catheters surgically implanted in preparation for&#xA;Dialysis. I had hoped that this day would never come. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s here, I am&#xA;feeling a wide range of conflicting emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I do enough to prevent getting here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did I push alternate theories, did we really find the cause, and is there still&#xA;some larger problem looming?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
