    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty quiet the last two months, getting used to the oh-so-fun
nightly task of peritoneal dialysis. As the year closes out, I figured that I
should provide an update.</p>
<p>So, every day/night for most of the last two months, my routine has been:</p>
<ul>
<li>some time during the day, set up the cycler machine for that night</li>
<li>around 20:30, get ready for bed (can I party or what?)</li>
<li>clean my hands, sanitize my hands, and plug in by 21:00</li>
<li>wipe the connection threads down for excess iodine and hop into bed (otherwise
you end up with iodine stains on the sheets)</li>
<li>go through four cycles over eight hours of
<ul>
<li>fill</li>
<li>dwell</li>
<li>drain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;all while hopefully sleeping through the entire thing.</p>
<p>But in two months, I haven&rsquo;t managed to sleep well enough to sleep through it,
although I&rsquo;ve come close.</p>
<p>I spend the night connected to the cycler by a tube that is roughly 2 meters
long. Given that I do need to wake up and pee on occasion, a fun plastic
container is kept near the bed for this purpose. Sexy, I know.</p>
<p>But what about number twos, I hear you ask? No, I am not keeping a bucket by the
bed. My wife has her lines that I cannot cross without consequences. I suppose I
could have bought a chemical toilet but I have elected not to, in favour of
simply unhooking when I need to and using the washroom.</p>
<p>There is one complication in unhooking though, and that is the constant use of
consumables to stay sterile. Medicine thankfully takes infection these days
very, very seriously. Sadly, as a result, medical waste is a real problem. I
have never seen that demonstrated so obviously as in going through this process.</p>
<p>The end of the catheter has an extension on it that is threaded, and a &ldquo;minicap&rdquo;
is kept screwed down on it when it is not being used. The minicap has a bit of
iodine inside, and is considered disposable. When you hook up, you discard your
current minicap. When you&rsquo;re done, you put a new minicap on. You change the
minicap when you shower, and if you unhook at night you also cap off the supply
line at the cycler with a &ldquo;flexicap&rdquo;. So you&rsquo;re constantly tossing the things in
the garbage.</p>
<p>Nothing compared to what you throw out when you&rsquo;re done each morning though.
I&rsquo;ll go through that in another post.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s mainly what I&rsquo;ve been up to for 2 months, beyond a couple of tests to
prove that dialysis is actually working (pesky doctors wanting actual
data&hellip;imagine). I can go into those later, not that it&rsquo;s an exciting topic.</p>
<p>Hopefully the power stays on. You hear that Ottawa Hydro? And for those who say
I should have a generator, I tried. The supply shortage a few years ago kept any
electrician from being able to get their hands on the transfer panels needed.
I&rsquo;m wondering how long my battery backup will run the cycler. I should try that.</p>
<p>Cheers people. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.</p>
