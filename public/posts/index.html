      <p>So, last week I was on <a href="http://www.mikeneedsakidney.ca/posts/dialysis_training/">dialysis training</a>,
and now it&rsquo;s the weekend. On friday, my dialysis supplies were delivered and my
cycler machine was set up in my bedroom.</p>
<p>The nice guys who delivered my supplies carried them into my office for me, as
I specified. And damn, did they deliver a lot of stuff.</p>
<p><img src="images/baxter_boxes.jpg" alt="Boxes in my office"></p>
<p>The initial order was put in by the nurses, and they are teaching me how to
submit follow-up orders myself. I&rsquo;m using a lot of google calendar. And there is
so much stuff that it&rsquo;s overwhelming, but luckily my wife is good at organizing
stuff. While we were in the hospital being taught, she was making lists and
ordering shit on Amazon. We stopped by a dollar store for some organizational
compartments for drawers, and now my bed&rsquo;s end-table is very well organized.</p>

      <p>So last week, I spent four days of the work week at the hospital taking a course
on Peritoneal Dialysis. Yeah, fun. Want to spend days in a hospital that is a
major pain to reach due to horrible traffic and lack of urban planning, where
they surgically modify your body and then teach you how to live with those
modifications. Sound fun?</p>
<p>The people were&hellip;awesome. The nurses, orderlies, and the doctors could not have
been better in how I was treated. How <em>we</em> were treated, actually, since my
amazing wife came with me. I mean, day one is scary enough, since they are
planning to cut you open and pull out the PD catheter so you can use it. They&rsquo;re
going to use local anesthesia, but I&rsquo;m always worried that it&rsquo;s going to hurt
anyway.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m surprised that it took this long. I&rsquo;ve had the website up for a while now,
and I just appeared in Glen Gower&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.glengower.ca/">newsletter</a>.
He&rsquo;s our local city councillor, and was kind enough to give me a few minutes of
his time recently.</p>
<p>But not everyone is quite so altruistic. I just received an email from a &ldquo;woman&rdquo;
(who knows?) asking if I am looking for a kidney, when obviously I am. I pointed
her at the Ottawa Hospital <a href="https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/clinical-services/deptpgrmcs/programs/kidney-donation/living-donation/">living donor
program</a>,
and then did a quick search on her email address out of curiosity.</p>

      <p>So, I just had a regular check-up with the CKD clinic. Sadly my kidney function
is now 9%. Yes, single digits.</p>
<p>The nephrologist said that it&rsquo;s important to find the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; to start
dialysis, between being strong enough to learn how, but close enough to really
need it. And she felt that this is that time, so I am now signed up for a 4-day
peritoneal dialysis course in about 2 weeks.</p>

      <p>Usually when it comes to government you can pretty much guarantee that if there
is a &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do something, it is probably <em>not</em> being done by your
government, either through incompetence or corruption. Sad but true. And when
they want to change, it is usually a slow, painful process that is far more
costly than it should be.</p>
<p>But now and then, a government gets something right. For example, in Singapore,
organ donation is opt-out, not opt-in, like it should be. Here,
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/seeking-healthcare/organ-donation">Check it out</a>.</p>

      <p>So, it would seem that my hoping, and occasional praying, for my condition to
turn around was, admittedly, a waste of time. Not really a surprise.</p>
<p>I was supposed to go to the course on Peritoneal Dialysis this month, but given
that my symptoms are not quite where the CKD clinic expects them to be, they
suggested that we wait until my assessment early next month to make a decision.
There is a very good chance that at the end of that I&rsquo;ll be signed up for the
course immediately.</p>

      <p>So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I
always dread those. They&rsquo;re never good news. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the
people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to
give me, and they&rsquo;re not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.</p>
<p>Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it&rsquo;s 10.
Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I&rsquo;ll find out in a month when I repeat the
testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y&rsquo;know, that ain&rsquo;t good.</p>

      <p>So, last Wednesday I dropped by the Riverside Campus of the Ottawa Hospital at the crack of dawn to have
<a href="https://www.azuravascularcare.com/infodialysisaccess/what-you-should-know-about-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter-placement/">Peritoneal Dialysis Catheters</a>
surgically implanted in my body. Y&rsquo;know, I could have just stayed home and worked remotely, but I thought it would be
fun to get some good drugs and have some holes cut into me.</p>
<p>Seriously though, my kidney function is dropping (somewhere around an
<a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr">eGFR</a>
of 15 and on the way down) and my doctors think it&rsquo;s a good idea to prepare. I really can&rsquo;t argue, even though I have
been dreading being at this point from about 2008 onwards. Side note: I have learned from experience that sticking my
head in the sand and hoping that a medical condition will simply go away does <em>not</em> work. Who knew?</p>
