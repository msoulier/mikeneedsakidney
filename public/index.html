      <p>Hi, I’m Mike and welcome.</p>
<p>A bit of information about myself.  I was born in Toronto to a small but loving
family. I spent time playing baseball as a kid, and lived on my bicycle.</p>
<p>By the time I was a teenager I was learning drums and guitar. Music has always
been a passion. In university, I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to do.  I
obtained a degree in Physics. I wasn’t sure I wanted to do a Masters but I
loved teaching, so I ended up going to Teacher’s college for my bachelor of
education. Having difficulty finding a full-time teaching position, I went back
to university to do a degree in Computer Science. There, I found my true
passion and also met my soon to be wife.</p>
<p>My path lead to Ottawa when I got at internship at Nortel Networks, which was
hot stuff back then. My how times have changed. I did well enough in my
internship that they offered me a full-time position. Around that time, I
married my wife. She also moved to Ottawa to work for Nortel.</p>
<p>We ended up buying our first house when we found out we were expecting.  We
moved to Stittsville in 2002, back when it was a few homes and miles of farmers
fields.  This time of my life was a bit of a blur.  I quit my job at Nortel and
moved to Mitel, where I am today, we had two kids and were busy raising a
family.</p>
<p>I didn’t find out I had kidney disease until 2008, when the doctor noticed
something during a routine physical. Since then, I’ve been working to delay the
disease&rsquo;s progression through a combination of diet and exercise.  It was working
until this past year when my numbers dropped low enough that doctors were
concerned about kidney failure and started to talk seriously about me needing a
transplant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to use this site to raise awareness about kidney disease, and
organ donation in general. And possibly get some help for myself, if anyone
was so inclined.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by. See the <a href="/donation/">Donation</a> page if you&rsquo;d like to help.</p>

            July appointment

        </h1>
        <div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">
          <p>So, I just had my July appointment with the Kidney Clinic at the Riverside. I
always dread those. They&rsquo;re never good news. I mean, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the
people at the Riverside Hospital are great, but they simply have no good news to
give me, and they&rsquo;re not about to downplay the seriousness of my situation.</p>
<p>Well, as usual, it got more serious. My eGFR was at 13 months ago. Now it&rsquo;s 10.
Is that a temporary drop? Not sure, I&rsquo;ll find out in a month when I repeat the
testing. They want to see me again in six weeks, so, y&rsquo;know, that ain&rsquo;t good.</p>

          <p>So, I asked an old curling buddy (yes, those exist) about his experiences with
kidney disease. He&rsquo;s farther along than I am, having just had a transplant
(yay!), so clearly I can learn from his experience.</p>
<p>He has gratiously permitted me to post this. I quote:</p>

<p>Hi Mike and Maria,</p>
<p>Feel free to use anything I&rsquo;ve written in your blog posts or on Facebook. All
dates are rough, I am using My chart, but some of the data is really buried
and there isn&rsquo;t a really good search engine on Mychart.</p>

Sudbury.com news.</p>
<p>I like the &lsquo;Vette.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The car show featured premium cars as well as live music, an ice cream truck,
food vendors and a kid zone. Given the name, the event also featured a booth
where people could sign up to be organ donors.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I love that. Nicely done people.</p>
