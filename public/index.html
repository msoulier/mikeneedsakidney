      <p>Hi, I’m Mike and welcome.</p>
<p>A bit of information about myself.  I was born in Toronto to a small but loving
family. I spent time playing baseball as a kid, and lived on my bicycle.</p>
<p>By the time I was a teenager I was learning drums and guitar. Music has always
been a passion. In university, I wasn’t quite sure what I wanted to do.  I
obtained a degree in Physics. I wasn’t sure I wanted to do a Masters but I
loved teaching, so I ended up going to Teacher’s college for my bachelor of
education. Having difficulty finding a full-time teaching position, I went back
to university to do a degree in Computer Science. There, I found my true
passion and also met my soon to be wife.</p>
<p>My path lead to Ottawa when I got at internship at Nortel Networks, which was
hot stuff back then. My how times have changed. I did well enough in my
internship that they offered me a full-time position. Around that time, I
married my wife. She also moved to Ottawa to work for Nortel.</p>
<p>We ended up buying our first house when we found out we were expecting.  We
moved to Stittsville in 2002, back when it was a few homes and miles of farmers
fields.  This time of my life was a bit of a blur.  I quit my job at Nortel and
moved to Mitel, where I am today, we had two kids and were busy raising a
family.</p>
<p>I didn’t find out I had kidney disease until 2008, when the doctor noticed
something during a routine physical. Since then, I’ve been working to delay the
disease&rsquo;s progression through a combination of diet and exercise.  It was working
until this past year when my numbers dropped low enough that doctors were
concerned about kidney failure and started to talk seriously about me needing a
transplant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to use this site to raise awareness about kidney disease, and
organ donation in general. And possibly get some help for myself, if anyone
was so inclined.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by. See the <a href="/donation/">Donation</a> page if you&rsquo;d like to help.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m surprised that it took this long. I&rsquo;ve had the website up for a while now,
and I just appeared in Glen Gower&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.glengower.ca/">newsletter</a>.
He&rsquo;s our local city councillor, and was kind enough to give me a few minutes of
his time recently.</p>
<p>But not everyone is quite so altruistic. I just received an email from a &ldquo;woman&rdquo;
(who knows?) asking if I am looking for a kidney, when obviously I am. I pointed
her at the Ottawa Hospital <a href="https://www.ottawahospital.on.ca/en/clinical-services/deptpgrmcs/programs/kidney-donation/living-donation/">living donor
program</a>,
and then did a quick search on her email address out of curiosity.</p>

          <p>So, I just had a regular check-up with the CKD clinic. Sadly my kidney function
is now 9%. Yes, single digits.</p>
<p>The nephrologist said that it&rsquo;s important to find the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; to start
dialysis, between being strong enough to learn how, but close enough to really
need it. And she felt that this is that time, so I am now signed up for a 4-day
peritoneal dialysis course in about 2 weeks.</p>

          <p>Usually when it comes to government you can pretty much guarantee that if there
is a &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to do something, it is probably <em>not</em> being done by your
government, either through incompetence or corruption. Sad but true. And when
they want to change, it is usually a slow, painful process that is far more
costly than it should be.</p>
<p>But now and then, a government gets something right. For example, in Singapore,
organ donation is opt-out, not opt-in, like it should be. Here,
